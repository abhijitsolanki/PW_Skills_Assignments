    "'''In Python, objects can be categorized into two main types based on their mutability: mutable and immutable.\n",
    "Understanding the differences between these types is crucial for programming efficiently and correctly. Let's explore each type with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable objects in Python cannot be changed once they are created. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object with the modified value.\n",
    "Immutable objects are safer to share across multiple parts of a program because they cannot be changed inadvertently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of immutable objects in Python include:'''\n",
    "'''1. **integers**\n",
    "2. **floats**\n",
    "3. **tuples**\n",
    "4. **strings**'''\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    " #1. Integers:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   a = 5\n",
    "   a += 1  # This creates a new integer object with value 6, a is not modified\n",
    "   print(a)  # Output: 6\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    " # 2. #Strings:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   s = \"Hello\"\n",
    "   s += \" World\"  # This creates a new string object \"Hello World\", s is not modified\n",
    "   print(s)  # Output: Hello World\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    " #3. Tuples:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   t = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   t += (4,)  # This creates a new tuple (1, 2, 3, 4), t is not modified\n",
    "   print(t)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutable Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Mutable objects in Python can be changed or modified after they are created.\n",
    "This means the object's state or contents can be modified, added to, or removed from without creating a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of mutable objects in Python include:\n",
    "1. **lists**\n",
    "2. **dictionaries**\n",
    "3. **sets**'''\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "list_cont = [1,2,3,4.3,(3+5j),True,\"abhijit\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    " #2. **Dictionaries:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "   d['c'] = 3  # Modifies the existing dictionary by adding a new key-value pair\n",
    "   print(d)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "'''- **Mutability:** Immutable objects cannot be changed once they are created, while mutable objects can be modified after creation.\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency:** Immutable objects require more memory allocation when a modification is made because a new object is created.\n",
    "Mutable objects may be more memory-efficient when frequent modifications are needed.\n",
    "- **Safety:** Immutable objects are safer to use in multithreaded applications or concurrent programming because\n",
    "their state cannot be changed once created, reducing the risk of unexpected side effects.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Understanding whether an object in Python is mutable or immutable is important for determining how you can manipulate it and how it behaves in different contexts within your program.\n",
    "#Immutable objects provide safety and predictability, while mutable objects offer flexibility and potentially better performance in certain scenarios."
